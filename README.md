# BurgerApp

Oh dear, this APP really doesn't work. The problem is with having the routing (POST/PUT/DELETE/GET) match up with the handlebars pages and the Mysql database. Unfortunately, what I just described, pretty much is the whole point of the app!

Nonetheless, this APP is supposed to allow users to add, delete or update to a list of burgers they would like to devour. If the user has already devoured a burger, it should populate on a separate list.

Firstly, I had a lot of trouble with CSS. I couldn't get the image to stay opaquely centered on the page with the form actions ontop. 'Z-index', 'background-position: center' and 'opacity:' didn't seem to want to work together.

Lasty, I adapted a lot of this from the CatAPP example we went through in class. However, I'm not fully understanding how handlebars and the separation of concerns and the functions for 'create: ', 'update: ', etc, work. I could go over this line-by-line and double check everything and put in some console.logs, but I shouldn't because we have Project 2 coming up...
